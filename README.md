# LaTeX Homework Template

This repository contains a basic LaTeX homework template. This has been tested on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) and [MacTex](https://tug.org/mactex/).
To use this repository, copy the `template.tex` to use for your homework.

```bash
$ cp template.tex math1234-hw01.tex
```

This distribution uses `xelatex` to compile the source code as it depends on [unicode-math](https://ctan.org/pkg/unicode-math).
